# Agent Memory – Liaura Matthews Personal Website

## 1. Project Overview
- Beautiful feminine personal bio website for Liaura Matthews
- Single-page static site (HTML/CSS/JS, no build step)
- Designed for Vercel deployment via GitHub
- Primary purpose: personal page that showcases Liaura's personality, aimed at meeting someone special

## 2. Definition of Done
- [x] Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- [x] Elegant feminine aesthetic with warm color palette
- [x] Photo placeholder system ready for real images
- [x] Scroll animations and micro-interactions
- [x] Navigation with smooth scrolling
- [x] Mobile hamburger menu
- [x] GitHub repo created
- [ ] Real photos added (requires Roger to provide)
- [ ] Email/social links updated with Liaura's real info
- [ ] Connected to Vercel (Roger will handle)
- [ ] Custom domain (optional, Roger to decide)

## 3. Current State
- Build: Complete static site
- Test: Renders correctly
- Deployment: GitHub repo created, awaiting Vercel connection
- Blockers: Need real photos from Roger

## 4. Architecture & Design Decisions
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS chosen for simplicity and zero build step
- Playfair Display + Cormorant Garamond + Jost font stack for feminine elegance
- Warm cream/blush/rose/sage color palette
- Photo placeholders with gradient backgrounds and camera icons
- Comments in HTML mark every replacement point with `<!-- REPLACE: -->`

## 5. Known Issues & Landmines
- Name spelling: ZoomInfo shows "Mathews" (single t) but Roger said "Matthews" (double t) — using Roger's spelling
- No public photos found online — all photos must come from Roger/Liaura

## 6. Debug History
- N/A — clean build

## 7. Proven Patterns
- Static HTML deploys instantly on Vercel with zero config
- IntersectionObserver for scroll-reveal animations

## 8. Failed Approaches
- N/A

## 9. Open Questions
- Correct spelling of last name (Matthews vs Mathews)?
- Liaura's actual email address for contact section
- Liaura's social media handles (if any)
- What quote/saying would she want?
- Is she still working as an RN? Current employer?

## 10. Next Actions
1. Roger provides 4-8 photos of Liaura
2. Roger confirms name spelling and contact info
3. Photos get added to images/ folder and HTML updated
4. Roger connects GitHub repo to Vercel
5. Optional: custom domain setup
